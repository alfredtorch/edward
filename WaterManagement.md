|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Temperature**             | Rising temperatures increase biological activity | Lowering      |
| **Biological Activity**     | Waste products can become acids through nitrification | Lowering |
| **Plants**                  | Absorption of CO2 during photosynthesis can change pH | Raising during photosynthesis; varies otherwise |
| **Nitrification**           | Conversion of ammonia to nitrite and nitrate produces acids | Lowering      |
| **Water Changes**           | New water can adjust pH depending on its own pH  | Raising or Lowering |
| **Time and System Maturity**| Accumulation of organic acids from waste and decomposition | Lowering      |
| **Alkalinity**              | Buffering capacity neutralizes acids, stabilizing pH | Stabilizing, potentially lowering as capacity is exhausted |
| **Decomposition of Organic Matter** | Releases acidic compounds into the system | Lowering      |
| **Aquaponic Media**         | Type of media can leach substances that affect pH | Raising if calcareous materials are used |
| **Feed Type and Quantity**  | Influences waste production and subsequent nitrification | Indirectly lowering |
