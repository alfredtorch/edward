# Milestone 2

## Current Prototype

### System Overview
The current prototype operates on an Ebb and Flow (Media-based) Aquaponics system, which requires a tidal mechanism to periodically raise and lower the water level. This process is crucial for oxygenating the roots and facilitating the filtration of nutrients in the plant tank.

The prototype system is powered by Home Assistant with ESPHome running on a local Raspberry Pi . The main challenges faced by the current system include:
•	not a standalone system (Raspberrypi + Station Controller)
•	no option for easy remote monitoring of the system (NAT, DNS)
•	missing control options (regular self-calibration, failsafe mode)
